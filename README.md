# Reinforcement-Learning--based-system-for-assisting-cab-drivers

Most drivers get a healthy number of ride requests from customers throughout the day. But with the recent hikes in electricity prices (all cabs are electric), many drivers complain that although their revenues are gradually increasing, their profits are almost flat. Thus, it is important that drivers choose the 'right' rides, i.e. choose the rides which are likely to maximise the total profit earned by the driver that day. For example, say a driver gets three ride requests at 5 PM. The first one is a long-distance ride guaranteeing high fare, but it will take him to a location which is unlikely to get him another ride for the next few hours. The second one ends in a better location, but it requires him to take a slight detour to pick the customer up, adding to fuel costs. Perhaps the best choice is to choose the third one, which although is medium-distance, it will likely get him another ride subsequently and avoid most of the traffic.  

Considering long-term profit as the goal for the cab drivers, the main objective of this project is to build an RL-based algorithm to optimize taxi driving strategies and decision-making process on the field for profit maximisation. This is an optimization problem based on Markov Decision Process.
